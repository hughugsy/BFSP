QandA is web application with a main purpose of providing students with Q&A platform for Bilkent University courses. It will be Stackoverflow-like platform. It will also have several different features such as teacher ratings, course materials for sell, private lessons, announcements and online sources. For teacher ratings we will create simple form consisting of maximum five questions which are really important to the students. Course materials is a section for selling and buying course related stuff such as books, FPGA board, notes and etc. In private lessons, section students can find tutor students for help. Announcements sections can be source of revenue through posting advertisements for university events. In online sources, section students can upload useful resources they have found on the web.
